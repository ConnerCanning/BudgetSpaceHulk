    <div>Space Hulk is a game in which one player controls Space Marine Terminators and tries to navigate through wreckage</div>
    <div>while another player controls Tyranid Genestealers and attempts to hunt the Space Marines. </div>
    <div>In this simulation Space Marines (Blue) attempt to cleanse the Xenos scum and Genestealers (Red) attempt to swarm them.</div>
    <div>Some cunning Genestealers wait in the walls where they can't be seen to overpower the Terminators with surprise attacks.</div>
    <div>This creates a pattern in which typically strong Terminators get caught alone and die to intelligent swarms.</div>
